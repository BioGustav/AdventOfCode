# Advent of Code
This repository will continue to grow from this year.
I do this for the first time and mainly for fun, not to be the first to get 2 stars on everything.
I try to solve everything in Rust since I want to gain experience using it.
Don't blame me for any inefficiencies, this language is new to me.
